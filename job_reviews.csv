The working hours are longer than expected and there is no compensation for the extra time you put in. once in a while you will receive items like nuts or muffins for your hard work, not extra pay or a justified bonus. the managers are not helpful and you live with stress every minute in the job as they are just out to expose your mistakes. one mistake made will be used as leverage for them to scare you throughout the year. you will be reminded of it during your appraisal when they reveal how little bonus you're getting. colleagues are average although most of them are backstabbers or rats. it is not an enjoyable workplace, neither does - more...",1

A typical workday includes food preparation, dish washing, and sandwich making. it can become very overwhelming during lunch and dinner hours, especially when there are only two employees present.

Personally, there was nothing enjoyable about the job; maybe just the occasional friendly customer. I learned that trying to be productive in the food business is somewhat impossible; always behind on other work that needed completed because of the high volume of customers and lack of other workers being scheduled to keep labor hours under control. I did enjoy working with the store manager and the other co-workers but that is it for me.

I'll qualify first that the pay and bonuses were promising (though I didn't stay long enough to reap the latter), and job security is a given as long as you hit your targets. The section I entered was filled with new hires who were given a system that suffered from an aging list of bugs and enhancement requests, with barely any handover. In addition, they lacked history with the system, and lacked guidance on how to perform basic maintenance tasks. Colleagues in other sections would try to help, but were limited due to their own workload and unfamiliarity with our system as well. The manager ""parachuted"" in was also bogged down with other systems of his own to oversee. I feel that the whole situation could have been managed much better. Aside from high-level documents, documentation of persisting production issues was sparse and poor, and during my time at the bank, we resorted to taking down notes as we went along. Outsourced technical support came from an overseas team, also a fresh team who did also not know about the history of the system, compounding to our difficulties in reining the issues in. To compensate, we would regularly work 11-hour days to fight the fires, with the overtime hours being ignored (the claims filed never got approved). During my time at the bank, it was clear that overtime was the norm, with even seasoned veterans (>20 years' experience) working beyond official working hours regularly.

Management is extremely in-experienced and for most of them it is their first retail jobs and they are fresh out of university, which means they are very figures based and know nothing about different methods of customer services and how to manage staff properly and effectively. You will deal with a lot of micro management from supervisors who are also in-experienced and dumb whom will check on you every 5 minutes even when you are doing a simple task like cleaning a mirror even if you have a lot more experience than them in retail they will just keep coming back yelling at you and telling you things you already know. The staff are very Cliquey so if you are not in with the cool kids who the managers favor forget about it, you will get treated like your right at the bottom and older staff members wont even acknowledge your existence.

No piercings, no tattoos.  Even after you get the job, if you want to move up, you have to score an 80 on your evaluation. Then, have to learn how to do alterations in a week. Sow a sort of sample to be judged upon. Then, you have to do an intense test and score a min. of 80 points. This test will include everything about the company: countless policies, standard ways to talk to people, the standard way to do everything. Then, if you pass, you also have to interview with your area and regional managers. Even associates have to do this. It is very intense to just get a $1,00 raise. You must also go through this just to become full-time. Ultimately, I left the company for the same reason all the managers do - too much stress and no work-life balance.

Your experience here will truly depend from store to store and region to region. I’ve worked at three stores with the company total over my two years with UNIQLO. The attitude towards employees with disabilities/health issues who aren’t able to keep up with near-constant 100%-capacity-and-beyond work for an abled person is abysmal. Microaggressions and condescending language are rampant—abled or not—and there is no subtlety. Managers are largely impersonal with an ego-inflated attitude to the point you are anxious to mention anything to them though there are some rare exceptions. Supervisors have made homophobic and transphobic jokes on the clock. Favoritism is the norm and you do not get promotions or raises if you are not friends with the managers—regardless of how hard you’re working. It took a state-mandated employment policy change to get the company to reliably send out schedules with more than 3 days notice. The company culture may be different in other regions/stores and I truly want better for UNIQLO as the potential is great and much of the product is high quality but it doesn’t seem like the company is ready to be in 2020.

You grow to depend on them and they can end up being some of the best friends you've met. The problem is when they start moving people around and break the synergy the team has.",3

My personal experience is that they will tell you to do something in a time frame but never taking into account the things that come up throughout the day that prevents this from happening in a certain timeframe.

The job encourages you to find your own way through every obstacle, and teaching others and even learning through their methods. Also, every time any opening/mid/closing team clocks in, there's a meeting where you go over sales and goes and announcements to better understand and learn how to engage sales and customers, along with reciting an impractical mantra.  The staff can make or break the experience. The schedule heavily relies on everyone showing up for their shift and if a coworker calls out it can effect everyone else's schedule drastically. Staff can also be unreliable due to; being under duress from the workload and many arbitrary tasks, personal weaknesses that haven't been improved upon, lack off communication, and system failures.

It's so professional and organized. Almost organized to the point you think this company suffers from OCD, but being this organize has helped me improve not only at work but in my life. Typical day at work is we clock in, line up, and wait for our supervisor from our division to tell us our sales goal (as well as other goals) and task us out to our section. If they task you out to a section where you have no experience they will often train you, but you have to tell them you have no experience 1st. Communication is key here, if you don't communicate with your supervisor or co-workers on the job you'll often find yourself in trouble. Best thing about this job is the environment itself. At Uniqlo they're all about executing the basics such as smiling at the customers, having correct posture, maintaining eye contact, facing the customer, and of course energy. It's a fast pace environment, but it can be a fun one if you make it that way. Hardest part of the job is perhaps working fitting room since you do everything in there and it's such a small space, but eventually you get the hang of it. Overall I recommend Uniqlo to anyone for a 1st time, 2nd time, even 7th time job because it really sets the standard in retail.",5

Every employee are also required to have a small notepad to take notes at all times.

They also are super rude to everyone and say it’s okay because in their words, they’re “the OG’s”.

I went for the interview and they said that I would have to work 20 hours a week. The work timing will be flexible and I would be to work on any day. All of this looked very appealing to me as the requirements were quite easy to follow for a student, which I was when I applied for the job. The interviewer said that I would be able to work on any day at any-time, as long as I complete 20 hours in a week. When I got the job and read the contract, it stated that ""You are required to work at least 4 days per week at a total minimum of 20 hours per week as per duty roster drawn up by your Superior. Any non-working days shall be deemed as off days."", all quoted from my contract, nothing changed by me. When I join, they tell me on the first day I have to work on the WEEKENDS, COMPULSORY. And on the weekends, I have to work until the shop closes at the end of thee day. None of this was specified by the interviewer and written in the contract. I was like okay, a bit of a stretch, but I can deal with those terms. When I tell my superior my duty roster, they state that my breaks are NOT included in my 20 hours. Now, in my previous part-time jobs, this was not a thing and even it was they would specify it when applying. THE PEOPLE AT UNIQLO TELL SOOOO MANY REQUIREMENTS OF THE WORK AFTER APPLYING.When I join the job, I was told that I would be entitled to a free set of clothes. I got NONE OF THAT.

We recited everything we wrote down to the supervisor and then clocked in. You'll either: greet up front, work the registers, do go-backs, or fitting room. During your shift, you have to make sure your zone is tidy. On Thursdays, after the store closed we focused on ""perfecting"" the store aka folding every pile and making sure the volume, length, etc. are aligned perfectly. You'll spend hours before the store opens or after closing just to clean (no matter how many times you clean/tidy the store, it'll never be up to their standards). Closing shift clocks out around 11pm - after other stores and the janitors left.  Hours were flexible but open availability during the weekend is MANDATORY. Pay is great for a part-time position, but the stress of working for this company isn't worth it. You can advance within the company if you take initiative, work with management, and work especially at cashwrap (register). I was always stuck greeting and when I mentioned doing something else to management, they said they want me to be a greeter to ""attract customers."" (which btw the manager even mentioned that she only hires attractive employees for her store) meanwhile all of my coworkers got a raise and learned to do other things in the store.

Overall, it is a stressful environment because all that you're required to know on top of the pace you're expected to work, combined with customers who are occasionally rude, may not speak any english, want you to personal shop for/with them (because the store moves everything around every week), on top of the common work place pettiness among employees.

It pretty much depends on who your dealing with. The higher up the manager is usually the more polite/efficient at doing there job but the immediate supervisors come off very rushed. I didn't receive the proper training until the ending of my job. The co workers aren't so bad. They will usually help you a lot faster then the managers and they make you feel welcomed.

Then you are assigned a zone in the store to focus on for the day...shifts usually range from 8-9 hours.  I worked at the Atlantic Terminal location and it was cool once i started off initially. It was painful with the opening and closing shifts because with the opening you'd have to make it to the store by 7am and with closing shifts you could  be in the store until about midnight.  The people (other employees) there honestly make the job worth coming into everyday. Management on the other hand is another story, nothing but complete nepotism at this location. Uniqlo follows a set list of rules that they expect ALL of their employees to understand and respect. Specific managers at this location abused the rules and used their titles to do what they want, even firing people unfairly. If you apply to this company, be aware of what you're getting into. At this location I learned time management, and striving for nothing but the best in terms of presentation. The company really drives you to be better than you are even if it feels like they constantly pick at your flaws. I learned more from my colleagues than I did from management and I'm not saying that all of management is bad but there are people in power at this location who only got their title because they were favorites of the stores general manager.  Other than that, the people honestly - more...",3

For a retail job, its kind of strict and demanding.  First dress code, you need to have plain clothing no patterns no logos with the exception of flannel, plaid, gingham, houndstooth ( but it cant be busy pattern). Basic colors are allowed as long as its not bright or neon or color blocking. I had to buy clothing because I own nothing but happy bright colors which was not an issue at my previous job, which I worked in an office and dress code was business casual. I would have preferred for them to assign uniforms honestly.  Felt kinda isolated and lonely when I first started especially if I wasn't scheduled to work with fellow new hires, people weren't mean but not super friendly either, they stuck to their friends. Once they knew me this all changed and I made friends with people who had beed working there for years.  Uniqlo has very high standards on floor presentation and maintenance. They expect a lot from workers and I feel like this can be unrealistic sometimes especially once the floor gets busy. They want perfection at the end of the night: size order, neat folded piles, go backs processed, clean floor, etc. All of this done within one or two hours depending on time allotted and whether they have side tasks for you.

There are many tourists who visit so we constantly had to get creative when trying to communicate. The people and friends I met while on the job are amazing, but management is very poor. They micro-manage everything that you do and expect you to do things beyond what you're getting paid for. Our team never got to leave on time. The closing shift is from 2 pm to 11 pm, but our team would always leave past 11:30 pm. They require everyone to be available all weekend and be able to close at least two or three days of the week. It was difficult to manage the time between school and work because they would schedule me as many hours as they could. I might as well have been full-time. When I needed fewer hours to be able to go to school they made it extremely difficult for me, so I quit. If you need many hours, this is a good place, but not if you only want to work the least amount of hours as possible. Even though your hours are usually packed after the holiday season ends, hours are cut tremendously, so beware. Also, managers have favorites and give them the best shifts and break times. Something else, they make you remember a bunch of things like 6 Standard Phrases and the company's principles. At store meetings, you have to chant and yell out these phrases and principles with the group.",3

It was great the first few weeks to months but it started to become extremely draining. Though I was part time I was given 39 hour shifts every single week, not that I minded too too tough but having to be approved for over time it seemed a bit ridiculous, for all that might as well made it full time and added the benefits. Even then I would of had to wait until moving to full time was an available option. Closing and Opening weren't the best,  Openings slightly easier since you could leave early (7am- 4pm).  Closings were a nightmare.. Closes were 2 hrs after closing time, so that meant we didnt finish until 11. Cool. But some nights it would stretch. Which meant I wasn't getting home until 12:30 to 1am. Which started to lead to a burnout. The culture can be strict, it's very particular. Things need to be a certain way and standard which I get that's how the business structure is. But eventually it takes a toll on you. Everything had to be basically perfect. Honestly what did it for me, I had a fold on a sweater I was trying to fix after being told to straighten it up and banged my finger and couldn't fold ( probably a pinched nerve) went to the bathroom and just cried. Couldn't keep up with it, the expectation, the perfection, and the lack of work life balance. That did it for me... other than that my co-workers were amazing people.

I have come to understand how important being a team player and supporting other members of staff. The most challenging moments in this job was that the job was very repetitive. However I believe that the team that I was with, made it more bearable. Throughout the year, I came to undertake the launch of Uniqlo Kids Wear. This was one of their new collection that were in high demands. My responsibilities was the incoming stock and taking care of the section. I was taught how to read the sale figures and understand the ordering of the stock. This became the most enjoyable part of the job because I was responsible for my own section and I was able to communicate to my line manager on a different level other than customer - more...",3

Uniqlo is all about company growth, and gives you the means, tools and specifications to earn pay raises and promotions. Overall, the stores I've worked at and assisted (Uniqlo as a whole is close knit - depending on how many stores are in an area, and your rank within the company, you may often have to aid other stores) have a close-knit team. Since everyone is training and learning a new thing, oftentimes the entire team knows how to do something and as such gets very close.  Basics areas include:Fitting Room Service - where you count customers in and clean/process gobacksCashwrap - cash registersGreeting - Front of the sales floor, greeting customers and providing customer serviceReplenishment - unpacking and folding/hanging clothes and pushing them out onto the sales floor Management varies drastically. Overall, management is nice, but adheres to Japanese ideology of placing customers as the top priority and working as hard as you can - to the point where you're even trained to walk quickly. It can be exhausting at first and good shoes are a must.

We received all of our sales floor training, as well as all of the company's beliefs and standards, at the Flagship store.  After about four weeks of training, we moved to our new location and spent two weeks preparing the store for opening.  The management team taught us everything, which included handling transactions, sales floor customer service, how to handle every interaction or conflict, and most importantly, how to be a team player.  The grand opening of the store provided chaos for about a month straight since there were endless sales and giveaways, which of course brought about many returns. Despite being hired as part-time, everyone had been consistently working 40+ hours per week since being hired.  With many of us being students as well, we definitely did not expect such strenuous hours.  After those few weeks though, the team got into a steady rhythm, and our hours finally began to average out to about 25-30 hours per week.  On the bright side though, with so many hours spent at work, many of us had become very good friends.  We were on good terms with all of our supervisors, and our shifts were really enjoyable.
